	<p>
Kamakhya Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the goddess Kamakhya, one of the 51 Shakti Peethas. It is located on the Nilachal Hill in Guwahati, Assam, India. The temple is considered to be one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Shakta Hindus, and it is also a popular tourist destination.

The Kamakhya Temple is believed to have been built in the 7th century AD, but it has been rebuilt and renovated several times over the centuries. The current structure of the temple dates back to the 16th century.

The temple complex is made up of several smaller temples and shrines, but the main shrine is a natural cave that houses a yoni-shaped cleft in the rock. This cleft is said to be the spot where the yoni (genitals) of the goddess Sati fell after her husband, Shiva, performed the Tandava dance with her corpse.

The Kamakhya Temple is a unique place in many ways. It is one of the few temples in India where the goddess is worshipped in her non-iconic form, and it is also one of the few Shakti Peethas where the yoni is worshipped.

The temple is also known for its annual Ambubachi Mela, a four-day festival that celebrates the menstruation of the goddess. During the festival, the temple is closed to the public, and devotees believe that the goddess is resting and replenishing her powers.</p>
